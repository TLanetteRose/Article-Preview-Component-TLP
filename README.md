![Design Preview for Article Preview Component from Frontend Mentor](./design/desktop-preview.jpg) 

## Background
When I started the design for this article preview component, I wanted to use Bootstrap. I decided to write my code without an html framework. It was a simple design and I thought my focus should be on the popup share feature. This was my first time coding this feature. I was pleasantly surprised at how simple it was to code. 

## My Challenge
I needed to build out this article preview component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. My users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size;
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon;


## Completed Design
